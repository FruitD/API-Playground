# API-Playground
This is a project meant to hold various python work and adventures.

In particular, I want to explore the Riot Developer API and its ability to integrate with the Discord API and Overwolf.

As an initial use case, I want BradBot to message me in Discord what champion I should play based on win % of champions inputted 

(Eventually integrating Overwolf to change the input from manual to opponent's champion)
