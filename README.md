# StinkRat
StinkRat is a bot in early development that is broadly intended to integrate a user's Discord and League of Legends experience. 

The project description is a rough draft and will change with important development decisions.

* Phase 1: The initial plan is to integrate the APIs by creating a Discord bot (using the discord.py library) that will display simple League of Legends data to the user through the Discord application (ex. Summoner champion preference).


* Phase 2: Implement interaction with the League Client API to obtain real time data, such as match-up information determined by a matches' champion selection process (ex. Display popular lane counters to a specific champion after it is selected to be played in a Draft match).
